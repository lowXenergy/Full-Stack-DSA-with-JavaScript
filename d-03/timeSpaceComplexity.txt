// Binary Search Algorithm Complexity?
Best case: O(1)
Target found at the middle on the first comparison.

Average case: O(log n)

Worst case: O(log n)
Search space is halved at each step.

// What does Big O notation represent?
Worst case time Complexity.

//If an algorithm run in O(N) time, what does it mean?
The algorithm runs in linear time.
If an algorithm runs in O(N) time, it means:
The running time grows linearly with the size of the input N.
If the input size doubles, the execution time also roughly doubles.

//What is the time complexity of this loop?
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
O(n)

//Which of the following is the fastest growing time complexity?
O(n log n)
O(n²)
O(2ⁿ)
O(log n)
Ans
O(2ⁿ),Exponential TC grows the fastest. It means the execution time doubles with every input, making it inefficient for large inputs.
